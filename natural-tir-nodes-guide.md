### Pre-built TIR Images

![TIR Pre-built Image Selection](https://docs.e2enetworks.com/assets/images/node_create_tirprebuilt-6fe32f7a774c2d3dadb7f5d167ca1392.png)

The image selection interface showcases E2E Networks' curated collection of AI-optimized environments. Each pre-built image is carefully configured with specific toolchains, frameworks, and libraries commonly used in AI development workflows.

**Jupyter Images** come pre-loaded with popular data science libraries including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn, along with deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. These environments are perfect for interactive development and experimentation.

**ComfyUI Images** provide visual, node-based interfaces for AI workflow design, particularly useful for creative AI applications and users who prefer graphical workflow management over code-based approaches.

**Framework-specific Images** are optimized for particular AI/ML frameworks, offering performance tuning and pre-installed dependencies that would otherwise require manual configuration.

> **ğŸ’¡ Quick Tip**: Choose images that closely match your intended workflow to minimize setup time and ensure optimal performance out of the box.

### Custom Base OS Configuration

![Base OS Configuration](https://docs.e2enetworks.com/assets/images/node_create_baseos-7822960dbeed2c236e77da807fe1c30e.png)

For users requiring maximum flexibility, the Base OS option provides a minimal foundation upon which you can build custom environments. The interface displays various Linux distributions with detailed version information and compatibility notes.

Ubuntu LTS versions are particularly recommended for AI/ML workloads due to their stability, extensive package ecosystem, and strong community support. The long-term support ensures your development environment remains stable and receives security updates throughout your project lifecycle.

When selecting a base OS, consider your team's existing standards, the specific requirements of your AI frameworks, and any organizational compliance requirements that might dictate particular operating system choices.

### Enterprise Container Integration

![Container Registry Configuration](https://docs.e2enetworks.com/assets/images/node_create_container_reg-7187dc5671d9cda2c7bbf059aa6e7fce.png)

Advanced teams often maintain custom container images in private registries or have specific versions of frameworks that aren't available in public repositories. The container registry integration allows seamless connection to Docker Hub, private registries, and custom repositories.

Authentication is handled securely through the interface, supporting both username/password and token-based authentication methods. This flexibility ensures compatibility with various organizational security policies and container management strategies.

**Best Practice**: Always use specific version tags (e.g., `tensorflow:2.13.0`) rather than generic tags like `latest` to ensure reproducible deployments and avoid unexpected changes when containers are rebuilt.

## Storage Architecture

### Comprehensive Storage Options

![Storage Configuration](https://docs.e2enetworks.com/assets/images/node_create_node_storage-078d77740cb90960b457a6b3581d607c.png)

TIR Nodes offer sophisticated storage architecture designed to meet diverse AI development requirements. The interface clearly distinguishes between different storage types and their optimal use cases.

**Persistent Storage** provides up to 5TB of reliable, network-attached storage that persists across node restarts and updates. This is ideal for datasets, trained models, and code repositories that need to be permanently preserved.

**Local NVMe Storage** delivers ultra-high-speed local storage perfect for temporary operations like model checkpoints, cache data, and high-throughput data processing tasks. While this storage is faster, it's ephemeral and will be lost if the node is recreated.

The pricing model is transparent, showing costs for different storage tiers and helping teams optimize their storage strategy based on access patterns and performance requirements.

**Storage Strategy**: Use local NVMe for temporary, high-speed operations and persistent storage for permanent data. This hybrid approach maximizes both performance and cost-effectiveness.
