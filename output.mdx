Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been at the helm of significant technological advancements in recent years. The technology, which powers everything from autonomous vehicles to personalized recommendation systems, is continuously evolving. One of the most recent advancements in this field is the development of AI agents, a concept that is transforming our perception and understanding of AI. 

Unlike conventional AI models, AI agents are not limited to excelling at a single specific task. Rather, they serve as proficient coordinators, capable of managing multiple AI capabilities while simultaneously maintaining a comprehensive understanding of the task at hand. They are designed to make informed decisions based on their learnings and dynamically adapt to the situation at hand. 

## Key Principles Underlying AI Agents

AI agents are underpinned by several fundamental principles that distinguish them from traditional AI models. 

### 1. State Management

This principle pertains to the agent's working memory or its ability to retain context about what it has learned and what it aims to achieve. This ability allows the agent to continue from where it left off, hold onto crucial information, and comprehend the overall goal of the task.

### 2. Decision-Making Framework

AI agents are equipped with a robust decision-making framework. They are designed to understand what tools and strategies are available to them and how best they can be utilized.
