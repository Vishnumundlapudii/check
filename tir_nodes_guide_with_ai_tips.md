**TIR Nodes: Containerized Environments for AI and Machine Learning**

**What are TIR Nodes?**

TIR Nodes are specialized, self-contained computing environments that provide a flexible and secure space for developing, testing, and deploying artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications.

**Key Features of TIR Nodes**

TIR Nodes offer a range of features that make them ideal for various use cases:

* **Interactive Development**: Use JupyterLab, a popular web-based interface, to interactively develop and test your AI and ML applications.
* **Compute Optimization**: Take advantage of optimized GPU and CPU resources to accelerate your machine learning workloads.
* **Customizable Environments**: Choose from prebuilt environments, including PyTorch, Hugging Face, and ComfyUI, or create your own custom environment to suit your needs.
* **Secure Access**: Access your TIR Node securely using SSH (Secure Shell) protocol.
* **Persistent Storage**: Store your data and models with persistent storage, featuring disk management for efficient data handling.

**Why Use TIR Nodes?**

TIR Nodes are perfect for:

| Use Case | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Training Machine Learning Models** | Train and fine-tune your machine learning models in a secure and optimized environment. |
| **Rapid Prototyping** | Quickly develop and test your AI and ML applications in an interactive and flexible environment. |
| **Data Processing** | Process large datasets efficiently using optimized compute resources. |
| **Deploying AI-based Solutions** | Deploy your AI and ML models in a secure and scalable environment. |

**Glossary**

* **Node**: A self-contained computing environment that provides a specific set of resources and tools.
* **Image**: A pre-configured environment that includes a set of software packages and dependencies.
* **Plan**: A predefined configuration for a TIR Node, including the type of compute resources and storage allocated.

## Creating a New Node

### Before You Begin

Make sure you have the following before creating a node:

- An active [MyAccount](https://myaccount.e2enetworks.com) login
- A project created under **TIR**
- An SSH key added to your profile (if you want SSH access)

> üí° **Tip**: You can add your SSH key anytime from **MyAccount ‚Üí Profile ‚Üí SSH Keys**.

### After Creation

Once the node is ready, its status will be **Running**. You can access it via:
- **JupyterLab**: From the dashboard's **Access** button
- **SSH**: If you enabled SSH during setup

## Configuring a Node

While creating a TIR node, you can customize several key options based on your needs. Here's a breakdown of each configuration step:

### üì¶ Image Selection

Choose the environment your node will run:

| Image Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Prebuilt Images** | Pre-configured containers optimized for ML/AI tasks (e.g., PyTorch, ComfyUI). |
| **Base OS** | A clean OS environment for full customization. |
| **E2E Container Registry** | Use a custom image you've uploaded to the E2E registry. |

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Compute Plan

Pick the processing resources your workload requires:

| Plan Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **CPU** | Good for development, data prep, and light workloads. |
| **GPU** | Required for training models, inferencing, or intensive AI compute. |

> üí° **Tip**: Some GPU plans require approval. You‚Äôll be notified during creation if your plan needs it.

---

### üìì Notebook Type

Decide how your Jupyter environment should be initialized:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **New Notebook** | Start with a clean, new workspace. |
| **Import Notebook** | Resume from a previously saved session. |

---

### üíæ Disk Size

Your storage defines how much data you can persist on the node:

| Disk Size | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| **30‚ÄØGB (default)** | Suitable for lightweight tasks and testing. |
| **Up to 5‚ÄØTB** | For large datasets, training checkpoints, or extended use.

> üí° **Tip**: Disks are persistent and mounted at **`/home/jovyan`** inside the container.

---

### üîê SSH Access (Optional)

Enable SSH if you prefer terminal-based interaction:

- ‚úÖ **Enable SSH** toggle during node creation
- üîë **SSH Key** must be added in **MyAccount ‚Üí Profile ‚Üí SSH Keys**

> üí° **Tip**: Always add your public SSH key *before* enabling SSH, or connection will fail.



## Accessing and Managing Your Node

Once your node is created, you can access and manage it through the following methods and states.

---

### üîó Accessing Your Node

You can access the node in two ways:

- **JupyterLab**  
  Launch directly from the dashboard by clicking the **Access** button. This opens a web-based interactive notebook.

- **SSH (Optional)**  
  If enabled during creation, connect via terminal using your SSH key.  
  > üí° **Tip**: Make sure your SSH key is added in **MyAccount ‚Üí Profile ‚Üí SSH Keys** before attempting access.

---

### üìä Node Statuses

Your node may transition through the following statuses:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Running** | Node is active. You can access it via JupyterLab or SSH. |
| **Pending** | Node is waiting for resources to be allocated. This may take time depending on demand. |
| **Stopped** | Node is turned off, but your data is retained. Restart anytime. |
| **Deleting** | Node is being permanently removed and will no longer be available. |

---

### üíæ Persistent Disk & Billing Behavior

> üí° **Tip**: All data is stored in a persistent disk mounted at **`/home/jovyan`**, which means your files remain safe even if the node is stopped or restarted.

> üí∏ **Cost Behavior**:
- While **Running**: You are charged for both compute and storage.
- While **Stopped**: You are charged **only for storage**.
  
> ‚úÖ **Recommendation**: Stop your node when not in use to reduce compute costs.



## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions
