## Understanding AI Agents

The essence of artificial intelligence is its capability to mimic human intelligence, and AI agents epitomize this idea. An AI agent is a system that can comprehend its environment through sensors and interact with that environment through its effectors to achieve a specific objective. The distinction lies in the AI agent's capacity to manage multiple capabilities while maintaining a comprehensive understanding of the task at hand. This enables the agent to execute a series of interconnected tasks more effectively and efficiently.
