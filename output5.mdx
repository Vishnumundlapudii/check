Artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed unprecedented growth over the recent years, heralding an innovative approach known as AI agents. As articulated in a blog post by Nir Diamant on Substack, AI agents symbolize a crucial transformation in AI technology. They often function as adept coordinators, managing multiple capabilities while possessing a comprehensive understanding of the task at hand. This article aims to demystify the concept of AI agents, elucidate their fundamental principles, illuminate the process of building one, and discuss their inherent limitations.

## Deciphering AI Agents

AI agents are distinctive in their ability to make informed decisions based on their acquired knowledge, akin to a human expert. These intelligent entities can adjust to evolving conditions and make decisions that align with their objectives. This capacity to learn, adapt, and make decisions differentiates AI agents from conventional AI technologies.

## Foundational Principles of AI Agents

AI agents are underpinned by several foundational principles. The first principle is the concept of state management, which can be viewed as the agent's working memory. This principle enables the AI agent to preserve context about what it has learned and what it aims to accomplish. 

The second principle is the decision-making process. The AI agent is equipped with the ability to make informed decisions based on its state management. This decision-making process is integral to how an AI agent operates and distinguishes it from other AI technologies.
