In the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence, a significant shift is taking place with the rise of AI agents. As noted by Nir Diamant in his article, "Your First AI Agent: Simpler Than You Think," AI agents function more like adept coordinators than traditional AI models. They orchestrate multiple capabilities while holding a comprehensive overview of the task at hand. The AI agents' ability to make informed decisions based on learned information positions them on par with a human expert in terms of problem-solving and decision-making.

## The Framework of AI Agents

The framework of an AI agent is built on various essential components. Foremost among them is state management, essentially the agent's working memory. This attribute allows the agent to retain and modify information over time, mirroring complex human cognitive processes.

Following this is the decision-making component. This feature empowers the AI agent to comprehend the tools and approaches at its disposal and select the most suitable ones according to the current scenario. This process mirrors the human ability to make judgments and decisions based on available information and resources.

Finally, an AI agent must have the capability to proficiently utilize tools. This involves the agent's ability to accomplish tasks, employ resources, and achieve its objectives.
