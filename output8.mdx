Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed numerous sectors, including healthcare and finance, but its potential is far from fully realized. One significant challenge AI continues to face is the fragmentation of AI models that operate in isolation. This fragmentation often leads to a lack of adaptability and integration among AI systems. To alleviate this concern, AI Agents have come to the fore as a promising solution. In an insightful article titled "Demystifying AI Agents: Simpler Than You Might Imagine", Nir Diamant from DiamantAI elucidates the idea of AI agents and their development using a tool named LangGraph.

## Understanding AI Agents

AI agents are constructed to function as proficient coordinators, managing multiple abilities while maintaining an all-inclusive comprehension of the task at hand. Unlike conventional AI models that divide tasks into separate steps, an AI agent deals with each task dynamically, modifying its focus and strategy based on the data it gathers during the process.

Diamant illustrates this with the example of analyzing a research paper about a novel medical treatment. A conventional AI would break the analysis into separate steps, potentially overlooking critical interconnections between different parts of the paper. On the other hand, an AI agent will take a more comprehensive and interconnected approach.
