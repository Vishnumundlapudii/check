Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving field, transitioning from conventional models to the more dynamic AI agents. This paradigm shift marks a significant advancement, as AI agents function like proficient coordinators, orchestrating multiple capabilities while maintaining a comprehensive view of the task at hand. In contrast, traditional AI models operate independently, lacking the ability to preserve context or make informed decisions for subsequent steps. In an exhaustive guide named "Your First AI Agent: Easier Than You Imagine", the author, Nir Diamant, provides an in-depth walkthrough on constructing an AI agent using LangGraph, a framework developed by LangChain. 

## AI Agents: Pioneering a New Epoch in Artificial Intelligence

AI agents introduce a novel, more dynamic approach to the AI milieu. They are proficient in state management, which serves as the agent's working memory, and possess a decision-making framework and effective tool utilization capabilities. State management gives AI agents the upper hand to maintain context, unlike traditional AI models. This context, coupled with decision-making abilities, empowers the agent to determine the optimal course of action and use tools effectively to accomplish its objectives.
