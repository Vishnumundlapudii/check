**TIR Nodes: Containerized Environments for AI and Machine Learning**

**What are TIR Nodes?**

TIR Nodes are specialized, self-contained computing environments that provide a flexible and secure space for developing, testing, and deploying artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications.

**Key Features of TIR Nodes**

TIR Nodes offer a range of features that make them ideal for various use cases:

* **Interactive Development**: Use JupyterLab, a popular web-based interface, to interactively develop and test your AI and ML applications.
* **Compute Optimization**: Take advantage of optimized GPU and CPU resources to accelerate your machine learning workloads.
* **Customizable Environments**: Choose from prebuilt environments, including PyTorch, Hugging Face, and ComfyUI, or create your own custom environment to suit your needs.
* **Secure Access**: Access your TIR Node securely using SSH (Secure Shell) protocol.
* **Persistent Storage**: Store your data and models with persistent storage, featuring disk management for efficient data handling.

**Why Use TIR Nodes?**

TIR Nodes are perfect for:

| Use Case | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Training Machine Learning Models** | Train and fine-tune your machine learning models in a secure and optimized environment. |
| **Rapid Prototyping** | Quickly develop and test your AI and ML applications in an interactive and flexible environment. |
| **Data Processing** | Process large datasets efficiently using optimized compute resources. |
| **Deploying AI-based Solutions** | Deploy your AI and ML models in a secure and scalable environment. |
