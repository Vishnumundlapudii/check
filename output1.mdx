The progression of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been nothing short of phenomenal. Progressing from the initial concept of rule-based systems to the inception of self-learning mechanisms, AI has indeed evolved significantly. The most recent advancement in this field is the introduction of AI agents, which aim to streamline the process of AI development and application. This article, heavily inspired by Nir Diamant's insightful piece, "Your First AI Agent: Simpler Than You Think," will explore the realm of AI agents and their practical applications.

## Comprehending AI Agents

AI agents mark a pivotal shift from conventional AI. Despite its power, traditional AI often suffers from a disjointed approach. It tends to lose crucial context during task execution and lacks the adaptability required for intricate, real-world tasks. Conversely, AI agents are engineered to coordinate multiple capabilities while preserving a comprehensive understanding of a task. They can make informed decisions grounded on what they acquire along the way, mirroring the decision-making process of human experts.

## The Core Principles of AI Agents

AI agents function based on several fundamental principles: state management, decision-making framework, and effective tool utilization. These AI agents are designed to complete complex tasks by managing their state, making informed decisions based on their framework, and effectively utilizing the available tools.
