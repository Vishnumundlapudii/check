## Overview

**TIR Nodes** are fully collaborative environments that make AI development possible. They combine the power of containers, Jupyter Labs, and AI/ML frameworks to create a readily usable workspace for you and your entire team.

### üéØ Common Use Cases

- **Fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs)** on single GPU using PyTorch or Hugging Face
- **Multi-GPU training** for LLMs or Diffusion models using DeepSpeed and Accelerate
- **Run Jupyter notebooks** from GitHub, Kaggle, or Colab
- **Download and review datasets** from TIR or Hugging Face
- **Test AI models** like Stable Diffusion or any LLM

> **üí° Pro Tip:** A TIR node is a fully functional coding environment. You can configure SSH access to work with command line tools, upload data via SFTP, or sync code with Git.

## üéØ Best Practices

### **Resource Selection**
- Use **Free Tier** for exploration and testing
- Choose **A100 or H100** for production workloads
- Consider **committed plans** for cost savings

### **Storage Strategy**
- Use `/home/jovyan` for persistent data
- Leverage `/mnt/local` (H100) for temporary high-speed storage
- Regular backups to EOS buckets recommended

### **Image Management**
- Start with pre-built images
- Save custom configurations as images
- Use `requirements.txt` for package management

### **Security**
- Prefer SSH keys over passwords
- Configure appropriate network access
- Regular security updates
