| **Compute Suspension** | Stop all processing while preserving data | 90% cost reduction | Temporary project pause |
| **Data Preservation** | All files, environments, and configurations maintained | Storage fees only (‚Çπ0.5/GB/month) | Seasonal projects |
| **Quick Resume** | Restart anytime during commitment period | Resume to full billing | Project reactivation |
| **Commitment Maintained** | Original commitment terms preserved | No early termination fees | Planned work interruptions |

**Suspension Process:**
1. Navigate to **Notebook Settings** ‚Üí **Power Management**
2. Select **"Suspend Notebook"** option
3. Choose **suspension duration** (if known)
4. Confirm **data retention** preferences
5. Set **auto-resume** triggers (optional)

#### Resource Downgrading

**Strategic Downgrades:**

| Current Configuration | Downgrade Option | Monthly Savings | Performance Impact |
|----------------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **p3.2xlarge (V100)** | ‚Üí g4dn.xlarge (T4) | -‚Çπ16,416 | 60-70% GPU performance reduction |
| **c5.4xlarge** | ‚Üí c5.2xlarge | -‚Çπ8,400 | 50% CPU and memory reduction |
| **GPU instance** | ‚Üí CPU equivalent | -‚Çπ4,566+ | No GPU acceleration |
| **High storage** | ‚Üí Reduced storage | -‚Çπ50-500 | Requires data cleanup |

**Downgrade Considerations:**
- ‚úÖ **Preserve Commitment:** Maintain discounted pricing structure
- ‚úÖ **Reduce Costs:** Significant monthly savings while keeping infrastructure
- ‚úÖ **Maintain Environment:** No data loss or environment reconfiguration
- ‚úÖ **Upgrade Flexibility:** Can upgrade again if requirements change

#### Conversion to Hourly Billing

**Hourly Conversion Strategy:**

| Scenario | Conversion Benefit | Financial Impact | Operational Flexibility |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| **Irregular Usage** | Pay only for actual usage | Potential savings for <40% utilization | High - start/stop anytime |
| **Project Uncertainty** | No commitment penalty | No refund for remaining period | Maximum flexibility |
| **Resource Scaling** | Easy resource modifications | Higher per-hour rates | Immediate changes possible |
| **Multi-Environment** | Share resources across projects | Cost optimization opportunities | Dynamic allocation |

**Conversion Process:**
1. **Evaluate Usage Patterns:** Analyze past 30 days of actual utilization
2. **Calculate Break-Even Point:** Determine hours per month where hourly becomes cost-effective
3. **Plan Transition:** Choose optimal conversion timing to minimize financial impact
4. **Execute Conversion:** Follow hourly conversion process outlined in previous sections

#### Resource Sharing and Team Access

**Collaborative Utilization:**

| Sharing Model | Implementation | Cost Distribution | Management Complexity |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Team Access** | Multiple user accounts on same notebook | Split costs among team members | Low - shared responsibility |
| **Time-Based Sharing** | Schedule access windows for different users | Proportional cost allocation | Medium - requires coordination |
| **Project Rotation** | Different projects use same infrastructure | Project-based billing | High - detailed tracking needed |

**Sharing Setup:**
1. **Configure User Access:** Add team members to notebook with appropriate permissions
2. **Establish Usage Guidelines:** Define access schedules and resource usage policies
3. **Implement Cost Tracking:** Set up billing allocation and expense reporting
4. **Monitor Utilization:** Regular review of usage patterns and cost effectiveness
